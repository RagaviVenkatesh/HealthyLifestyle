            <h2>Eat more fruits and veggies</h2>
            <p>Eating more fruits and veggies can protect against cancer, autoimmunity, and 
                even mental health issues. The recommendation is to eat at least 2 servings of fruit and 3 servings of vegetables per day. 
                The recommendation is to eat at least 2 servings of fruit and 3 servings of vegetables per 
                day. So strive to get all those veggies and fruits in your diet to ensure you get all the nutrients you need.
                Eating small meals throughout the day is good for your metabolism, but eating the 
                right things is what matters most.

            <h2>Exercise</h2>
            <p>Exercise is good for both your physical health and your mental health. 
                That makes it essential for a healthy life style. Not just a few times a week, 
                but every day. By moving your body in some way for 30 minutes a day, you 
                will lower your risk of disease, create higher bone density and potentially 
                increase your life span. </p>

            <h2>Emotional Health</h2>
            <p>Living a healthy life style is not just about our physical health, it's also 
                about our mental health. It's about changing our thoughts, emotions, and 
                behaviors in ways that make us feel better. Managing negative emotions also 
                has ripple effects that help us decrease stress and improve our physical health. 
                So it's all connected.</p>

            <h2>Drink a lot of Water</h2>
            <p>
                Most of us donâ€™t drink enough water every day, but it is essential for our 
                bodies to work properly. Water is absolutely necessary for carrying out our 
                bodily functions, removing waste, and transporting nutrients and oxygen throughout 
                our bodies. Since water is expelled every day through urination, bowel movements, 
                perspiration and breathing, we need to replenish the amount of water in our bodies 
                constantly. The amount of water we need depends on a variety of factors, but generally 
                an average adult needs two to three liters a day. </p>
